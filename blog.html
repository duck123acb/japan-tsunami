            <span class="blog-text" id="going-to-spain">
              This is one of the more interesting stories. 
              I went to the King Fernando the VII (7th) of Spain, but he was all like: “nO, wE haVe cHrIsToPHeR CoLuMbuS.” Or something like that, so I went all the way to <span class="itallic">England</span>, but they were like (in their British posh voice): “oOoOoH tHe KiNg WoNt LiKe YoU, wItH yOuR sTuPiD iTaLiAn NaMe” So I went and changed it to my English name: “John Cabot”. 
              I went back in, and the guards treated me as if I was an entirely new person. Anyway, I went in, and saw him, <span class="itallic">King Henry the VII (7th)</span>. 
              After being refused once before, I was kinda nervous, but I got the job, and left with high spirits.

          <span class="title">Second adventure:</span>
          <br>
          <span class="blog-text" id="second-adventure">
            After my first attempt at sailing, we had no luck. But on my second journey, <span class="itallic">that&#39;s</span> where it gets interesting. We found land! 
            “ASIA!!!!!” my crew screamed! Little did they know... “No, good sirs, this is new, undiscovered land! I&#39;m naming it <span class="itallic">New Found Land</span>.” 
            I replied, feeling excited. “Let&#39;s look for treasure!” one said, excited. “Not with that cod you won&#39;t” another said. “OMGZZZ CODD!!!” I screamed, very unexplainably, “Let's get some!”
            My crew lowered a bucket, and the bucket was filled with cod! I very professionally resisted the urge to sing “Here some cod, there some cod, everywhere some cod cod OLD MC CABOT FOUND NEW LAND, EE III EEE III *pause for dramatic effect* OOOOOOOOOO!” 
            Anyway, that is the end of this post! P.S. The king loved <span class="itallic">my</span> discovery of cod. *Annoyed crew member who told me where the cod was starts to get angry*

            This blog post is from under the deck. It has been a terrible storm, and we are just hanging on. 
            We might not make it to land, and I miss my wife and children, especially Sebastian. 
            There is shouting in the background. Like I said, this maybe my last post. I must go. 
            My crew needs me. Bye...

          <span class="blog-text" id="were-safe">
          We survived! We managed to dock at Ireland, and now we are back at sea! 
          For a moment, I thought we were going to die. Now, there are no storm clouds in any direction. 
          *Looks out window* Oh no... There are some storm clouds on the horizon, but it&#39;s very faint. 
          But the ship is going fast. We will hit it soon, so I better warn my crew.

          We&#39;re in a storm again, and this time a wimp just left on a small boat. 
          “I wAnna LIvE” he screamed as he left. Like I said, wimp. I started thinking of achieving immortality, as I want to continue exploring. 
          The astrolabe and compass are not working. I think... we are lost at sea. 
          This is it for today. If you see all these posts, then it means that I have achieved immortality. 
          Bye... For the last time...
